Scrabble Book Game - Final Project (Advanced Software Development-1)

This is the final project for the Advanced Software Development-1 course. The project consists of three main parts, and this README currently covers the first part, which involves creating the "Scrabble Book" game with a server-side component.

Part 1: Scrabble Book Game Server

The first part of the project is the development of a server-side application for the "Scrabble Book" game. This part includes the following four main files:

1. Board.java: This file contains the implementation of the game board and its associated logic.
2. Tile.java: This file defines the structure and behavior of the individual tiles used in the game.
3. Word.java: This file handles the management and validation of words formed during the game.
4. MainTrain.java: This is the main entry point for the application, responsible for running and testing the game logic.
The server-side application is designed to handle the core functionality of the "Scrabble Book" game, including board management, tile placement, word validation, and scoring.
